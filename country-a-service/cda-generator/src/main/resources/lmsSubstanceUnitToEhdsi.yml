# Mapping from LMS15 "substance" (unit type 3) codes to eHDSI unit values.
#
# Codes and values are based on:
# - eHDSIUnit and eHDSIQuantityUnit from MVC 7.2.0
# - LMS15 codes from 20240503.
# TODO more of these. there are a lot.

# Some thoughts. We do have units with both number and unit in the denominator. (MGH: mg/24 timer)
# In eHDSI, they write that we have to write the units as num/den, except in the case that the
# number cannot be converted to that. I take that to mean that the numbers should be whole?
# Yeah. I won't try to convert anything from decimal to fractional.
