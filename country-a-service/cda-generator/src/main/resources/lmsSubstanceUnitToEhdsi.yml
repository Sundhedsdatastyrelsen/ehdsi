# Mapping from LMS15 "substance" (unit type 3) codes to eHDSI unit values.
#
# Codes and values are based on:
# - eHDSIUnit from MVC 7.2.0
# - LMS15 codes from 20240503.
#
# Values are maps of
# - "lms15-display-name" the description from LMS15, if there is information there that cannot be coded.
# - "numerator" the unit type of the numerator, defaults to "1"
# - "denominator" the unit type of the denominator, defaults to "1"
# - "denominatorValue" the value of the denominator. Must be parseable as a BigDecimal. Defaults to "1"
#
# As a first effort, I have taken the top 10 most used units. These account for about 95 % of all drugs.
