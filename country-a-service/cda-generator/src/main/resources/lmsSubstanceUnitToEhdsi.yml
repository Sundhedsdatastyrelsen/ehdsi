# Mapping from LMS15 "substance" (unit type 3) codes to eHDSI unit values.
#
# Codes and values are based on the agreed substance unit map with LMS. Should be found under the semantics folder
# on sharepoint.
#
# Values are maps of
# - "lms15-display-name" the description from LMS15, if there is information there that cannot be coded.
# - "numerator" the unit type of the numerator, defaults to "1"
# - "denominator" the unit type of the denominator, defaults to "1"
# - "denominatorValue" the value of the denominator. Must be parseable as a BigDecimal. Defaults to "1"
