# Updating the openncp version

## Code

TODO

## Configuration

Upgrading the configuration isn't simple, it requires compiling a list of changes to the openncp repo at <https://code.europa.eu/ehdsi/ehealth> from the previous version to the version updating to, and then manually going through the changes to determine what should be reflected in this repo and what shouldn't.

Please have a look in update-diary.md for historical context, lists of files to look out for, and scripts to help with the process.
