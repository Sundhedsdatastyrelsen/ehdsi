/**
 * This package is created to hold the integration testing functionality, in order to re-use the same functionality in
 * both the integration tests (located in FmkPrescriptionIt) and in the shaded command-line utility used to prepare
 * data for the same integration tests. This need for running the (exact) same functionality different ways necessitated
 * streamlining the way the tests are run, which is why the signatures are almost alike.
