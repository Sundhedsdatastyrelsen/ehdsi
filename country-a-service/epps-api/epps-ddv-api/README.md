NCPeH DK integration service - FMK API
===============================================================================

This contains the wsdl and api from "Det Danske Vaccinationsregister" (DDV) services.

To avoid conflicts between FMK and DDV, we have to rename the DDV packages, since they are mildly different in
versioning and capitalization.

The generated source files are checked in, and can be regenerated by building (from epps-root) using the command

```bash
mvn compile -Pgenerate-ddv-files
```

They will not be generated on a normal build
