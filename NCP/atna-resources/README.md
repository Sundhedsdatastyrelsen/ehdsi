# OpenATNA

This contains copies of the configuration values from the docker ATNA setup in the ehealth repository https://code.europa.eu/ehdsi/ehealth, at `openncp-docker/openncp-configuration/ATNA_resources/`.
We've replaced some hardcoded values with environment variables.

The documentation of the OpenATNA configuration is listed in `openncp-application/openncp-application-openatna/README.txt` with several dead links, so it's not easy to determine what the values here actually mean.
