# Authorization registry integration

The interface is documented at https://www.nspop.dk/display/public/web/SDM+-+Guide+til+anvendere#SDMGuidetilanvendere-5.5Enkeltopslagiyderregistret,
where they also link to the wsdl which is at http://test1-cnsp.ekstern-test.nspop.dk:8080/stamdata-authorization-lookup-ws/service/AuthorizationService-20240105?wsdl.

Remark that we need the 2024-01-05 version, as we also need the specializations of the health personnel.
